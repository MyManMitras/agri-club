                p1: 'Mandya District is very well known to be a predominantly agriculture oriented district in Karnataka State. Government owned major industrial unit - The Mysore Sugar Company - an agriculture based unit - was the one and only Industry in the District.  Later, another industry - The Mysore Acetate and Chemicals Company was set up by the Government which also utilized the Acetic Acid manufactured by the MSCo. Ltd. To manufacture Cellulose Triacetate.  It is natural that there were a number of businessmen involved in dealing with the major agricultural input - Chemical Fertilizers.  Their business was also seasonal and had to spend their idle days with some other activity.  It was then that a sizable group of the citizens of Mandya City, who experienced the lack of a relaxing atmosphere, away from the ever haunting struggle for livelihood, be it their business, their office or house, where they can lay back and enjoy their life by indulging in various indoor games like Table Tennis, Billiards, Snooker, Shuttle Badminton, Table games like Carom, Chess, Card games, etc., joined their hands and zeal to establish this AGRI CLUB (R), Mandya, in the year 1986-87.  These games are arranged in separate rooms so that any one of them is disturbed while playing their game of choice.  Led by Sri B. Muralidhara, these enthusiasts got the Club registered with the authorities on 12-11-1986 and were allotted the Registration No. 90/1986-87.',
                p2: 'Initially this group could muster the support, involvement  and participation of about 100 likeminded people and has now swollen to about 250.  Likewise, the Club was run in a rented building for many years.  During the tenure of Sri C.  Devaraju as President, the club with an intention to carry out its activities and acquire a own building, a site was purchased on the Bangalore-Mysore Highway on 03-11-2004 and subsequently a lavish, well equipped building of its own, comprising of a Party Hall, Cards Hall, Gym Section, a well equipped Canteen Section, Two suites, Two A/c Rooms, Two Rooms, a well landscaped Roopa Garden, was constructed.',
                p3: 'The building in which the Club is presently housed was inaugurated on 20-10-2013. Sri C. Srikanthu was the President of the Club at that juncture. The elegance of the Club Building, the deceptive facilities built-up in the club, the ambiance of the location, are bound to attract many more people to join it.',
                p4: 'Presently, the members of the Club have elected Sri B. Siddaraju as its President for the years 2017-18.  Sri Siddaraju, is the former President of the City Municipal Council, Mandya.'
